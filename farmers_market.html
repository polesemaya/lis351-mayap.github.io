    <h1> Farmers Market </h1>
   <p> In the fall and springtime, I love to go to the farmers market 
     with my friends. I have celiac, which means I cannot eat gluten. The farmers
     market has a lot of treats for people who are gluten free, 
     like myself, as well as lots of fresh produce and other interesting 
     and fun stands! </p>
