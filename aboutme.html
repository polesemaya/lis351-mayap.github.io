    <h1> About Me </h1> 
    <p>I am a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am in my first year in the J-school, 
      majoring in Strategic Communications with a Digital Media certificate, as well as a Digital Media Analytics Certificate. 
      Our ever-changing world requires a miscellaneous perspective in the workforce, especially in the communications/journalism domain. 
      I was drawn to the SJMC because of the unequaled dedication to giving its students experience across all media landscapes. 
      I’ve always been interested in the inner workings of advertising and Public relations, and I’m hopeful to land a job in one of these fields. 
      The best way to contact me is through email or phone </p>
